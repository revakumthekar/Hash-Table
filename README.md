Files Written by Me:
--------------------
<List all files that were within this project that were written by you, and
 include a short description of the purpose that each file servers>
HashTableMap.java - Creates the workings of a Hash Table, where each node inside a Hash Table holds a key-value 
    pair to map it in a certain spot inside. The Hash Table also resizes itself if the load capacity is greater than or equal 
    to .85 by doubling the capacity and rehashing the keys.
MapADT.java - This is an interface that holds all of the methods that need to be instantiated.
TestHashTable.java - Tests the HashTableMap.java class to see if all of the methods work as they should and if a Hash Table data structure is successfully created.
